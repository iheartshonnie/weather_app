# Weather GUI App 

## Description
This is a Python-based weather app that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter`. The app allows users to:

- Enter their name and age
- Select their favorite weather type
- Enter a city and retrieve current weather data (temperature & description)

It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and reuses CLI logic from provided modules.
